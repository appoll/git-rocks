10 Commission recommendations for travelling safely in coronavirus times
* Book tickets and check-in online to avoid queues, when possible
* Respect social distancing during luggage drop-off, security checks, boarding and baggage claim
* Fewer passengers may be allowed on board and you might be asked to sit at a distance from passengers who are not part of your household.
* When social distancing is difficult to ensure, you might be asked to wear face masks
* Food, beverages and other goods may not be available on board
* Transport companies may install protective barriers, for example between passengers and a coach driver. You may be asked to board through the back door
* Drivers should open doors automatically at every stop, so passengers don’t have to touch buttons or handles
* Stations, ports and airports should guarantee regular cleaning and disinfection and provide sanitising/disinfecting products, including on board
* There should be appropriate ventilation on all transport
* Passengers can choose between refund or rerouting for cancelled tickets. If the transport company offers a voucher, you still have the right to ask for a refund
